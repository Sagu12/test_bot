                                1. Open the TrulyMadly app on your smartphone.

                                4. To be eligible for TM Cafe, you need to fulfil the following criteria:
                                   - Add a clear profile photo
                                - Fill in your education and professional details

                                8. If you want, you can take a 90-second real-time date with someone you like. This allows you to get to know them for real via virtual dates, rather than just liking them based on photos and bio.
                                9. If you both say "yes" to each other, it's a match! You can continue your conversation in chats.

                                You can complete both processes in the profile section of your "My Account" page.
